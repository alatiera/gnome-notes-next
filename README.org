* GNOME Notes

  GNOME Notes is a simple Gtk+ Application for joting notes.

  *Note:* This is an experimentation on rewriting Bijiben (ie, GNOME notes).
  Thus this code shall (hopefully) be merged back to Bijiben as a whole,
  or this will stay as a new project if other maintainers disagree.

  The code is now in pre-alpha stage. And so, merge requests and
  bug reports are currently not accepted.

  Home page: [[https://www.sadiqpk.org/projects/notes.html]]. Please note
  that repository URLs shall change, so please link only to the above
  URL if you are wishing to refer this repository.

* How to compile

  meson build system is used for building ~gnome-notes~. Also,
  a compatibility script is provided so that you can simply do
  =./configure && make && sudo make install= from the source
  root directory to compile and install.
